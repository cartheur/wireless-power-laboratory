# 141S Spectrum analyzer (se need outputs!)

In order to compelte a laboratory concern, restoration of a one 141S Display Section from two that had boards and electron tube onto a solid powered backend but with slightly-twisted frame from damage during transit when purchased. Thanks Jimmy.

But the effort turned out well and the machine is ready for analytical tasks. I would like to illustrate these tasks:

* The Model 'F' receiver card with 8601A tracking generator.
* More.
