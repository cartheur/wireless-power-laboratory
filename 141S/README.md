# 141S Spectrum analyzer

In order to compelte a laboratory concern, restoration of a one 141S Display Section from two that had boards and electron tube onto a solid powered backend but with slightly-twisted frame from damage during transit when purchased. Thanks Jimmy.

But the effort turned out well and the machine is ready for analytical tasks.
