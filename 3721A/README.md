A central part of analysis lies in the probability of signals being where they are expected as to yield data of the performance of a given process or another.

An idea is to leverage this unit with its companion gear:

* 3722A Noise Generator
* 5245L Electronic Counter
* 5263A Time Interval Unit
* 5267A Programmable Voltmeter

To measure field quantities on the surfaces of coils. And other interesting tasks. But is bloody hot and these little space heaters make the laboratory environment less tenable. And this is a substantive thing. It certain is the thing to do. We can determine this that this is so.
